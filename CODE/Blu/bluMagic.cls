'LaVolpe: _
"Paul Caton has done some amazing things combining ASM and VB. Unfortunately, he has _
 moved on from VB and left this code to me. His original code can be found at the _
 links provided below. I am taking the initiative to learn from his thunks, update, _
 rewrite, or otherwise improve those thunks. Therefore, some of this code will differ _
 significantly from Paul's original work. As an ASM newbie, I welcome any _
 suggestions/corrections for the ASM code itself.

'If you are new to these thunking routines, here is the basic idea:

'1. Make subclassing, hooking, callbacks IDE-safe. No crashes due to END or STOP
'2. Be able to allow subclassing, hooking, callbacks to use a class, form, _
    property page or usercontrol to call back to (just like an AddressOf pointer)
'3. Allow that 'AddressOf' pointer to exist in any VB code object

'Original work done by Paul Caton. _

'I have now completely revamped the subclassing ASM. It is larger than Paul's original _
 work but I believe it is now 100% END safe, IDE-safe. I have even placed END _
 statements inside of the callback procedures and IDE did not crash. The additional _
 ASM code added to Paul's original work, included use of a self-killing delay timer _
 that keeps the ASM alive in virtual memory and doubles as a trigger to delete the _
 virtual memory.

'The issue with Paul's code regarding usercontrols that subclass ContainerHwnd _
 multiple times has been resolved with the use of the timers.

' Other subclassing thunk modifications/enhancements are listed below:
'   - thunks can also be used inside of property pages if so desired
'   - subclassing thunks will automatically release after window processes WM_NCDestroy message (last message a window gets)
'   - subclassing thunks can destroy a parent-less API window that is subclassed, when IDE ends (optional parameter)
'   - as mentioned above, use of a delay timer appears to make subclasser 100% safe, crash-proof
'   - callback thunks can be individually set & released
'   - callback thunks have optional parameter to auto-kill timers when IDE ends
'   - hook thunks can filter on before and/or after messages just like the subclassing thunks

'   Above all being said, the ASM thunks are but a small part of what Paul Caton put together.
'   Without his zAddressOf and zProbe functions, easy subclassing and containment would not
'   be where it is right now. We all owe him a bow of respect for that.

' Unicode is supported in subclassing and hooking. Not applicable with callbacks because pointers are only used.
'   - Since VB windows are not unicode windows, unicode support is not provided by default
'       However, VB can create unicode windows via CreateWindowExW, therefore...
'   - To request unicode support, supply the appropriate parameter to the ssc_Subclass and/or shk_SetHook routines
'       -- check the bUnicode parameter's return value to validate success
'       -- if successful, ensure you use unicode API calls, unicode strings as needed
'           --- Exceptions. If either the following tests (depending on situation) returns false, unicode will not be used
'           1) Subclassing: The window being subclassed must return non-zero from IsWindowUnicode(hWnd)
'           2) Hooking: Non-zero must be returned from IsWindowUnicode(GetDesktopWindow)
