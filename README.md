# MaSS1VE: The Master System Sonic 1 Visual Editor #

![MaSS1VE Screenshot] (http://camendesign.com/_stuff/MaSS1VE_d.png)

Why? It didn't exist. Many tools exist for the 16-bit Sonic the Hedgehog, but I belong to the small, quiet group who will always prefer the 8-Bit Sonic 1; for what it lacked in big 16-bit graphics they made up with extra game-play, charm and memorable music. It surprised me that a level editor didn't already exist when there are so many for 16-bit Sonic.

*NOTE: The project is currently in pre-alpha stage and is not yet "user-ready". Consider helping out:*
